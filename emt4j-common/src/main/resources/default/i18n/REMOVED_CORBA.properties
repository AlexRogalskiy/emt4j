title=Removal of CORBA Modules
description=In JDK 11, CORBA modules were removed. These modules were deprecated for removal in JDK 9. Existing code with references to classes in these APIs will not compile without changes to the build. Similarly, code on the classpath with references to classes in these APIs will fail with NoDefClassFoundError or ClassNotFoundException unless changes are made in how the application is deployed.
solution=There API was removed from JDK, so you need to add explicit dependencies to your projects. See http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/320
