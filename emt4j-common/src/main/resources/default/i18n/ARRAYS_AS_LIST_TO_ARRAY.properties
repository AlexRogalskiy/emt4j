title=Arrays.asList(x).toArray() return type changed from JDK 8 to JDK 9
description=Arrays.asList(x).toArray().getClass() should return result with type Object[]. However, if x is an instance of String[] type in JDK8, the return type is String[]. \
The following code works in JDK 8, but a ClassCastException exception will throw in JDK 9 and later. \
        URI[] uriArray = new URI[2]; \
        uriArray[0] = new URI("http://www.foo.com"); \
        uriArray[1] = new URI("http://www.bar.com"); \
        List<URI> uriList = Arrays.asList(uriArray); \
        URI[] uriArray2 = (URI[]) uriList.toArray();
solution=Use "<T> T[] toArray(T[] a);" that support generic type.
