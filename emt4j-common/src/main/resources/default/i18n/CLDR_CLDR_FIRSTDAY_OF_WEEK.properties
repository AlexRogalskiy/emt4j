title=java.util.Calendar.getFirstDayOfWeek. For some input,the return values, JDK 8 and JDK 11 are inconsistent.
description=For the following code:\
Locale locale1 = Locale.forLanguageTag("nl"); \
System.out.println(new GregorianCalendar(locale1).getFirstDayOfWeek()); \
The output of JDK 8 is 2,but output of JDK 11 is 1.
solution=1. Add "-Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT" to the java option so that change default locale date from CLDR to COMPAT(JDK 8 default). \
         2. When instance a "java.util.Locale" object, provide both language and region, not only language part.
