title=Non-heap memory footprint increasing
description=Netty uses the direct byte buffer internally. There 2 ways to manage the direct buffer lifecycle, the first it's managed by Netty self, and the second is managed by JVM. In JDK 8, netty uses the first way, but in JDK 11, netty uses the second. The first cannot be monitored through MXBean, but the second can be monitored. 
solution=If you want keep the first way,add the option to JVM:"-Dio.netty.tryReflectionSetAccessible=true --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens=java.base/java.nio=ALL-UNNAMED" when running on JDK 11.But if use the second way,the netty should upgrade to a version at least 4.1.33. Because the older netty use a remove API tht release byte buffer.
